# pands-problem-set

This repository contains the problem set for the subject Programming & Scripting in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics 2019 

The file for problem 1 is called sumupto.py. The program asks the user to input a positive 
integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between 1 and that number. 

The file for problem 2 is called begins-with-t.py. The program outputs whether or not 
today is a day that begins with the letter t. 

The file for problem 3 is called divisors.py. The program prints all numbers between 
1000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12.

The file for problem 4 is called collatz.py. The program explores the Collatz Conjecture. It 
asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following 
calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is 
even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. The program ends 
if the current value is one.The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will 
always reach 1.

The file for problem 5 is called primes.py. The program asks the user to input a positive 
integer and tells the user whether or not the number is a prime.

The file for problem 6 is called secondstring.py. The program takes a user input string and 
outputs every second word.


The file for problem 7 is called squareroot.py. The program takes a positive floating point 
number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. It uses the Newton square root 
method to do this. 

The file for problem 8 is called date_time.py. The program outputs today’s date and time in the 
format “Monday,January 10th 2019 at 1:15pm”

The python file for problem 9 is called second.py. The program reads in a text ﬁle and outputs every 
second line.The program takes the ﬁlename from an argument on the command line.The text file I used to 
test it is mobydick.txt - a text file containing the first hundred lines of Moby Dick. 

The file for problem 10 is called functions.py. The program displays a plot of the functions x, x² and 
2ˣ in the range [0,4]
